# Write a script that inspects a log file 

# use the lastlog file on the WWU lab machines 
# this file is located in /var/log
# the overall goal is to iterate though this log file and determine useful info based on what is found in the log file 
# Our goal: how many times did user X log in between January and December 

# two cmd args: target user and target date range (in months) 

# must include one function (what do I want this function to be?)
